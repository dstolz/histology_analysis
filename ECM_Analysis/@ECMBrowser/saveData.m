    % Three layouts, because three different things get asked of one
    % view. "wide" is a depth column and one intensity column per
    % section, which is what a plotting program wants pasted into it.
    % "long" is one row per sample, carrying every field the sections
    % can be grouped or filtered by, which is what a statistics
    % package wants; the depths a section never reached are left out
    % rather than written as blanks. "sections" is one row per section
    % -- the table beside the profiles, with the peak added to it on
    % the scale the plot is drawn on, and the summary metric the Metric
    % control names taken over the depth window on screen.
    %
    % Under a comparison all three are written per comparison rather
    % than per section, and "sections" carries the account of it:
    % which operation between which two values, how many sections
    % went into each side, and the peak of the result.
