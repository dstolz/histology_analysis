    %LAYOUTLEGEND One legend for the whole layout, outside every axes.
    % The entries are stand-ins drawn at NaN rather than the curves
    % themselves. A curve belongs to one tile and a group need not
    % appear in the first of them, so a legend built from whatever sits
    % under it would list only what that tile happened to hold; drawn
    % at NaN the stand-ins change no limit, and marked with their group
    % they follow a color picked from a right-click menu the way the
    % curves do.
    %
    % MATLAB places a legend outside a tiled layout by naming the side
    % it goes on, so the horizontal band lands between the layout title
    % and the top row of plots, and the column beside the right-hand
    % one. Either way the room every tile was spending on its own copy
    % of the key goes back to the plot.
