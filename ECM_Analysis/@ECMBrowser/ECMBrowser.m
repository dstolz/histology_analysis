%   B = ECMBrowser(A)
%
% A is the struct returned by ECM_PREPARE_ANALYSIS_DATA. Everything drawn
% comes from A.grid -- one column per section on a shared depth axis -- and
% A.grid.files, the section table beside it, which supplies every field the
% profiles can be colored, tiled, and filtered by.
%
% Working off the grid rather than the point-level table is what keeps this
% simple: sections are already on one depth axis, so a group mean is a mean
% across columns rather than a regrouping, and any field of the section table
% can group or tile without recomputing anything.
%
% The controls are gathered into sections that open and close from the bar
% naming each one -- Signal & scale, Compare, Plot, Split, Filter, Layout,
% and Configurations. Any one figure is settled by three or four controls,
% not by all two dozen, so the panel opens on the sections most figures are
% made of and leaves the rest shut. A shut section says on its own bar what
% it is holding -- the comparison in force, how many filter conditions are
% standing -- so nothing narrows the plot from out of sight, and a count of
% what is drawn runs along the foot of the window under both halves of it.
%
% The controls are, in order:
%   Signal      Smoothed or raw intensity.
%   Normalize   A rescaling of the intensities, applied on top of whatever
%               ecm_prepare_analysis_data was asked for: a z-score, a 0-1
%               range, a fraction of the peak, unit area, or a comparison
%               against a baseline band. Taken from the smoothed trace
%               whichever trace is drawn, and applied to the peak summary as
%               well as to the profiles.
%   Scope       How much of the figure shares one scale. Per section rescales
%               every profile on its own, which lines up their shapes and
%               throws away every difference in level between them; the wider
%               scopes -- one scale per color group, per group within a plot,
%               per plot, or one across every plot -- keep the differences
%               inside the pool they take, so what is drawn together stays
%               comparable. Only the sections in view are pooled, so a filter
%               narrows the scale as well as the plot, and the plot scopes
%               follow whatever Tile by holds, several fields included.
%   Ref. min/max
%               The depth window the normalization is taken from: the range
%               that sets the scale, and the band the baseline modes measure.
%               It is a control of its own rather than the depth window on
%               screen, so zooming in does not rescale the plot and the
%               normalization still reaches the peak summary.
%   Compare     Measures one level of a field against another within the same
%               subject, plate, or whatever else the sections are matched on,
%               and draws the comparison in place of the sections it came
%               from. A difference, a ratio, a log2 ratio, a percent change,
%               or a normalized difference (a - b) / (a + b), which is bounded
%               and is what a laterality index usually means.
%   Compare by  The field whose values are being measured against each other
%               -- Hemisphere, say.
%   Reference   Which of that field's values is b, the one everything else is
%               measured against. A field of three or more values yields one
%               comparison per value against the reference rather than only
%               a pair. Some fields have no such value -- subject is the
%               plain case, one animal being no more the reference than
%               another -- and are asked about within themselves by the two
%               choices at the head of the list instead. Each vs. the rest
%               measures every value against all the sections of the match
%               that hold another value, which is one curve per value and is
%               how an outlying subject shows itself; every pair measures
%               each two values against each other once, which is every
%               comparison there is to make and grows quickly with the number
%               of values.
%   Pair within Which fields have to agree for two sections to be compared.
%               Subject and plate is the usual answer: a left section is
%               measured against the right section of the same plate of the
%               same animal, not against every right section in the study.
%               Where a match holds more than one section on a side, the two
%               sides are averaged first and the comparison taken between the
%               averages, so one section against one and three against two
%               are handled the same way. A match missing the reference value
%               yields nothing and its sections are counted in the status
%               line. Comparisons are taken after the normalization, so a
%               scope that rescales the two sides separately -- per group,
%               with Color by set to the compared field -- would take out the
%               difference before it is measured.
%   Show        Every section, the group mean with an error band, or one point
%               per section: the peak summary in peak depth against peak
%               intensity, or the metric summary in whichever single number
%               of the curve the Metric control names, plotted down the
%               groups. A comparison is drawn in place of the sections, so
%               its curves are what is shown, averaged, and summarized, and
%               its peak is the depth it departs furthest from no difference
%               -- zero, or one for a ratio.
%   Metric      What one point of the metric summary measures, for the metric
%               summary alone: how much signal there is under the curve (its
%               mean, median, or integral), where it is (peak height and
%               depth, the two peaks a double-peaked profile has and the
%               separation between them, the centroid), how wide it is
%               (FWHM), or how much it varies (range, variance, standard
%               deviation, coefficient of variation, slope). Unlike the peak
%               summary, which reads A.peaks as ecm_prepare_analysis_data
%               measured it, these are read off the curve on screen: the
%               depth window, the signal, the normalization, and a comparison
%               all reach them, so the summary and the plot beside it are
%               always answering the same question. Sections are drawn as one
%               point each, spread across their group's place on the axis,
%               with the group's mean ruled through them and the error band
%               drawn as a bar rather than as a band.
%   Error band  What the band around a group mean spans, and what the bar
%               through a metric summary's group spans: the spread of its
%               sections, a normal interval for their mean, or a bootstrap
%               one that resamples the sections instead of assuming a shape
%               for them and may sit unevenly around the mean.
%   Color by   Field whose values become the groups. Legend entries are per
%               group, not per section, so a plot of 85 sections still has a
%               legend that fits. Under a comparison the compared field holds
%               the comparison instead of its own values, so coloring by
%               Hemisphere colors by "Right - Left" rather than by Right and
%               Left, and every other field carries whatever the sections
%               behind a comparison agreed on, or "(mixed)" where they did not.
%   Marker by   Field whose values pick the marker a section is drawn with,
%               beside whatever it is colored by: the point itself in the two
%               summaries, and a few markers along each curve where the
%               profiles or their means are drawn. Sections of one color that
%               differ on this field are drawn -- and averaged, and summarized
%               -- apart, so a group mean colored by Treatment with markers by
%               Hemisphere is one mean per treatment per hemisphere, and a
%               metric summary sets the hemispheres side by side within each
%               treatment's slot. A legend lists the values in gray under the
%               groups, each in the marker it stands for.
%   Line style by
%               The same for the line style of a curve: solid, dashed, dotted,
%               and dash-dot in turn, repeating past the fourth value. It
%               reaches the profiles and the group means, which are the modes
%               that draw curves; the two summaries draw points and leave it
%               grayed out. A comparison is matched on both of these fields as
%               it is on the color, so no comparison spans a marker or a line
%               style either.
%   Tile by     Fields whose values each get their own axes. Pick more than
%               one -- plate and subject, say -- and every combination the
%               sections actually hold gets an axes of its own: the last field
%               runs across the columns and the ones before it down the rows,
%               so a column can be read from row to row. Transpose swaps
%               the two.
%   Filter by   Which field is being narrowed, and which of its values to
%               keep -- or, with Values set to drop, to throw out. A field
%               is remembered once it has been narrowed, so moving on to a
%               second field adds a condition beside the first rather than
%               replacing it, and several parameters are filtered on at
%               once. Putting every value of a field back selects nothing
%               and takes its condition off the list again.
%   Combine     Whether a section has to satisfy all of the conditions or
%               any one of them -- an AND across them, or an OR. Offered
%               once there are two conditions to combine, one condition
%               meaning the same thing under either rule.
%   Filters     The conditions standing, one to a line. Picking one puts the
%               two controls above back on the field it names, so it can be
%               widened or narrowed where it is; Remove takes it off and
%               Clear all empties the list. Filters pick sections rather
%               than comparisons, so they are applied before any pairing and
%               narrow what there is to compare.
%   Depth       The depth window drawn, in the profiles' own distance unit.
%   Transpose   Turns the grid of axes on its side: the field that ran
%               across the columns runs down the rows instead, and the ones
%               before it across the columns. It rearranges the axes rather
%               than what is drawn in them, so everything else -- the
%               normalization, the curves, the legend, an export -- is
%               unchanged by it. One tiled field flows across the layout
%               untransposed and stacks into a single column transposed.
%   Legend      Where the key goes. Per tile is one legend inside every axes,
%               as it has always been; the two consolidated placements draw a
%               single legend outside them all -- a horizontal band across the
%               top of the layout, under its title, or a column down its right
%               -- and hand the room the repeated keys were taking back to the
%               plots. A consolidated legend lists every group in view whether
%               or not a given tile holds it, so one key reads across all of
%               them, and it follows a color or line style set from a
%               right-click menu the same way the curves do.
%
% Right-click a curve, its error band, or the axes to change the color,
% line style, and marker of a group. The change is made to the group rather
% than to the artist under the cursor, so it lands on every tile at once,
% survives the redraw the next control change forces, and reaches a figure
% POPOUT has already put on screen. A curve's menu leads with its own group
% and keeps the rest one level down; the axes menu offers every group evenly.
% With a field on Marker by or Line style by, the menu offers that field's
% values as well, so which hemisphere is the dashed one is still a choice,
% and the groups' own line style or marker is grayed out meanwhile, the
% field having taken it over. A choice is remembered against the field as
% well as the value, so a palette set up under one Color by field is still
% there after a detour through another.
%
% Fields are offered for grouping and tiling when they take between 2 and 25
% distinct values, and as filters when they take up to 100. A section
% identifier is therefore something to filter one section out by but not to
% group on, a measurement of the section is neither, and a field that holds
% the same value throughout is left out of all three. Several fields tiled
% together can ask for more axes than a screen can show anything in, so the
% ones past the 64th are left undrawn and the status line says so.
%
% Configurations, the last section of the panel, remembers the state of every
% control above -- not a color or line style set from a right-click menu,
% which is
% kept of its own accord. Save adds the state on screen now to the list under
% an autogenerated name; picking a name back out of the list puts the panel
% back the way it was; Delete removes the name showing, and Purge every name
% at once. The list is kept in MATLAB's own preferences rather than a file of
% its own, so it survives from one ECMBrowser to the next, and a config saved
% against a field this dataset does not have -- a color-by, tile-by, or
% filter field from a different one -- is left unset rather than refused.
%
% A toolbar sits over the plot, holding the things reached for over and over
% while a figure is being settled on: copy the plot as an image or as vector
% graphics, save it, copy the numbers under it or the account of the view,
% send them to the workspace, pop the plot out into a figure of its own, and
% Reset, which puts the depth window, the scale, and the filter back. All but
% the last are on the Plot and Data menus as well, spelled out at more length
% there; the toolbar is the short way to the few that get used every time.
%
% Export, on the menu bar, is how anything leaves the browser, and what it
% sends out is the plot alone -- the panel of controls is how a figure was
% arrived at, not part of it. The plot is redrawn into a plain figure for
% each export, at the size it is on screen and on the limits it was left at,
% so a zoom is exported rather than thrown away and a vector format is
% available, which it is not from a uifigure. Copy puts it on the clipboard
% as a PNG or as vector graphics; Save plot writes PNG, TIFF, or JPEG for
% a bitmap, PDF, EPS, or SVG for something that stays sharp at any size, and
% .fig for the figure itself, still open to editing. Data sends the numbers
% under the plot the same way: to the base workspace, to the clipboard, or
% to a CSV -- one column per section for a plotting program, one row per
% sample carrying every field the sections can be split by for a statistics
% package, or one row per section for the peaks and the summary metric in
% force. Under a comparison a column
% is a comparison rather than a section, and the last of the three says what
% was measured against what, how many sections went into each side of it,
% and where it departs furthest from no difference. Image resolution and
% Background set what the bitmap formats are written at and whether the
% paper behind the plot is white or left out altogether, which only the
% vector formats can do; both are kept for the session. Copy view summary writes out every choice that decides what
% the plot means, which is what a methods paragraph needs and a screenshot
% does not hold. Copy code writes the same view out as the commands that
% rebuild it -- setComparison, setTiling, and the rest, one line each --
% which is what belongs in the script that makes the figure for the paper,
% and is the only way a color picked from a right-click menu leaves the
% browser at all.
